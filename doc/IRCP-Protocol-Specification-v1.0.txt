                                        IRCP PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION 1.0
                                        -------------------------------

1. MOTIVATION
In 2019, a group of former players of the Spanish MMORPG "La Prisi√≥n" was created with the intention of recreating
that game using current technologies. The biggest obstacle that the project suffered was the creation of a robust,
secure, fast, and low-cost server.

As a programmer, I have always been interested in the creation of an MMO and I believe that the best way to approach it
is starting with something simple yet complex enough to resemble the final intention.

IRCP fulfills that purpose. By simulating an original IRC server, it has to consider concepts such as rooms, users,
encryption and own sub-programs, which range from rolling dice to a game of chess.

2. TERMINOLOGY
The terminology used in the protocol is detailed below:

- IRCP (Internet Relay Chat Plus)
- IRCPP (Internet Relay Chat Plus Protocol)
- Package (Un conjunto de bytes estructurados de una forma concreta para contener datos necesarios para IRCPP)

- Payload Size (16 bits):  The size of the Payload field. This represents the length of the Payload data.
- OP Code (16 bits)     :  The operation code indicating the type of operation to be performed.
- Checksum (32 bits)    :  Used for error-checking of the header and data portions of the packet.
- Payload (variable)    :  The actual data being transferred. This is variable in length, from 0 to 512 bytes.
